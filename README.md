FIRST VERSION of what will be known as something life lifestats.com or lifetracker.com or some variation of that.

This repo will not be what is used in production, just a prototype to test different technolgoies and build a basic version.

I know it says v2 at the end, but this is really v0, v1 was botched cause of some setup mistakes. v0 was never a thing before
